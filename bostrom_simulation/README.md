## Usage

0. Install Python3 if you have no
1. Go to `bostrom_simulation` folder
2. Install requirements via pip3
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
4. The notebook server should be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8888` 

5. Open `simulation.ipynb`

6. Fill `Initial state` and `Params for simulating` sections

7. On the top bar `Kernel`->`Restart & Run All`

8. The simulation time depends on the simulation period you have set, f.e. for 7 years it approximately 1 hour
